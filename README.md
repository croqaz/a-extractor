The database format is [JSON5](http://json5.org), a strict subset of Javascript, also available as a normal JSON.

The extraction expressions are [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org), similar with jQuery.

The targeted information is:
- **the author**
- **the date** when the article was written
- and of course, the article text, as clean as possible

This project is designed to be used with [Clean-Mark](https://github.com/croqaz/clean-mark), but you can use it however you want.

## Important

[Clean-Mark](https://github.com/croqaz/clean-mark) already has algorithms to extract most of the info, if the website is SEO friendly, eg: it respects schema.org/Article, or Microformats, or the Open Graph protocol.<br>
But it's not a perfect tool ü§ñ  and it needs help from us humans üôÑ
